ADAPTIVE_INITIAL_PLANNING_PROMPT = """You are creating an initial task plan for a document analysis query. Create 2-4 focused tasks that will help gather information to answer the user's question.

QUERY: {query}

AVAILABLE DOCUMENTS:

TASK CREATION RULES:
1. Create focused, specific tasks (not generic "search" tasks)
2. Each task should look for specific information needed to answer the query

5. For each task, specify which documents are most relevant to search
6. Don't create more than 4 tasks for the initial plan

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a JSON object with a "tasks" array. Each task should have:
- "name": Short, clear task name
- "description": Specific description of what information to find
- "document": Single document ID that is most relevant for this task

EXAMPLE:
Query: "What were our Q3 financial results?"
Available Documents:
doc_1: Q3 Financial Report
Summary: This document contains comprehensive Q3 financial data including revenue breakdowns by product line, operating expenses, profit margins, and comparative analysis with Q2 results. Includes detailed income statements and cash flow analysis.

doc_2: Annual Budget Planning  
Summary: Contains budget allocations for the full fiscal year, projected expenses by department, and variance analysis comparing actual vs budgeted amounts for Q1-Q3.

RECENT TOPICS: {recent_topics}

CURRENT QUERY: {current_query}

Create a reformulated query that:
1. Resolves pronouns (e.g., "it", "this", "that") to their actual subjects from context
2. Keeps the query SHORT and focused ONLY on the current question's intent
3. Does NOT include previous questions or combine multiple intents

5. If the query is already clear and specific, return it unchanged

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Focus on what the user is asking NOW, not what they asked before
- Only add context needed to understand references
- Keep the query concise for optimal document search

EXAMPLES:

Example 1:
Context: User asked about "machine learning model performance"
Current: "What about its accuracy?"
Output:
{{
  "reformulated_query": "What is the machine learning model accuracy?"

Example 2:
Context: User asked about "impact of climate change"
Current: "How about its applications?"
Output:
{{
  "reformulated_query": "What are the applications of climate change research?"
