Create a reformulated query that:
1. Resolves pronouns (e.g., "it", "this", "that") to their actual subjects from context
2. Keeps the query SHORT and focused ONLY on the current question's intent
3. Does NOT include previous questions or combine multiple intents
4. Expands unclear abbreviations if needed
5. If the query is already clear and specific, return it unchanged

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Focus on what the user is asking NOW, not what they asked before
- Only add context needed to understand references
- Keep the query concise for optimal document search

EXAMPLES:

Example 1:
Context: User asked about "machine learning model performance"
Current: "What about its accuracy?"
Output:
{{
  "reformulated_query": "What is the machine learning model accuracy?"
}}

Example 2:
Context: User asked about "impact of climate change"
Current: "How about its applications?"
Output:
{{
  "reformulated_query": "What are the applications of climate change research?"
}}

Example 3:
Current: "Tell me more about the benefits"
Output:
{{
  "reformulated_query": "Tell me more about the benefits"
